Specifications:
I want to extend the UI and state functionality:
- Each new conversation should be associated with the current working directory in Neovim (uv.cwd())
- In the history window, I want to be able to display one directory per line: the top-level directory name (e.g. docs/, if not unique, then include the parent in the name) on the left side of the line, and the last modified date/time on the right


Can utils.generate_id() be improved?
